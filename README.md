# my discord bot template

so essentially this is how i build all bots i make... it's adapted from [polar's template](https://github.com/OtterDevelopment/typescript-discord-boilerplate) with some changes such as a nice upgrade to djs v14, aswell as some changes to the code itself.

eventually i'll probably add a few more things to this, but for now it's a good start.
i'll also make a nice readme for the people who want to use this.
